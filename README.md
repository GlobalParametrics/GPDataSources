# GPDataSources
An overview of data sources used by Global Parametrics for index development

## GP Data Classes
GP maintains a repository of climatology, forecast, and extreme event data that is useful for assessing risk from geophysical phenomena.  These datasets are broadly characterized with the following nomenclature:
- Weather (WX)
- Tropical Cyclone (TC)
- Earthquake (EQ)

## GP Data Collection
GP generates datasets using propritetary algorithms and maintains a repository of publicly available data.  GP harmonizes each dataset to have consistent datetime and variable conventions, lowering the barrier to comparisons between disparate models. Public datasets that GP maintains include:

[CFSR](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/climate-forecast-system-reanalysis-cfsr) Global climate reanalysis generated by NCEP/NCAR. Covers the time period from 1/1979-3/2011. Sub-daily data.
[CFSv2](http://cfs.ncep.noaa.gov/) Operational global climate forecast generated by NCEP/NCAR and distributed by NOAA.  Covers the time period from 3/2011 - Present. Sub-daily data.
[GFS](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs) Operational global weather forecast generated by NCEP/NCAR and distributed by NOAA. Covers the time period from 3/2004 to Present. Sub-daily data.
[CHIRPS](http://chg.geog.ucsb.edu/data/chirps/) Near realtime global precipitation dataset generated by the Climate Hazards Group. Covers the time period from 1981 to Present. Daily data.
[GPCC](https://www.dwd.de/EN/ourservices/gpcc/gpcc.html) Global precipitation dataset generated by the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC).  Covers the time period from 1891 to Present. Monthly data.
[TRMM](https://pmm.nasa.gov/TRMM) Global precipitation dataset generated by NASA. Covers the time period from 3/2000 to 4/2015.
[GPM](https://pmm.nasa.gov/GPM) Global precipitation dataset generated by NASA. Covers the time period from 3/2014 to Present.
[GSOD](https://data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00516) Global Summary of the Day is weather station dataset maintained by NOAA and the WMO.  Covers a variable time period from 1929 to Present, with data from 1973 to Present being the most complete.
