# GPDataSources
An overview of data sources used by Global Parametrics for index development

## GP Data Classes
GP maintains a repository of climatology, forecast, and extreme event data that is useful for assessing risk from geophysical phenomena.  These datasets are broadly characterized in the following data classes:
- Weather (WX)
- Tropical Cyclone (TC)
- Earthquake (EQ)
- Exposure (EX)
- Physical Properties (PP)

## GP Data Collection
GP generates datasets using propritetary algorithms and maintains a repository of publicly available data.  GP harmonizes each dataset to have consistent datetime and variable conventions, lowering the barrier to comparisons between disparate models. 

Public datasets that GP maintains include:
