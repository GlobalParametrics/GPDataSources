# GPDataSources
An overview of data sources used by Global Parametrics for index development

## GP Data Classes
GP maintains a repository of climatology, forecast, and extreme event data that is useful for assessing risk from geophysical phenomena.  These datasets are broadly characterized with the following nomenclature:
- Weather (WX)
- Tropical Cyclone (TC)
- Earthquake (EQ)

## GP Data Collection
GP generates datasets using propritetary algorithms and maintains a repository of publicly available data.  GP harmonizes each dataset to have consistent datetime and variable conventions, lowering the barrier to comparisons between disparate models. 

Public datasets that GP maintains include:

-[CFSR](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/climate-forecast-system-reanalysis-cfsr): Global climate reanalysis generated by NCEP/NCAR. Covers the time period from 1/1979-3/2011. Sub-daily data.
-[CFSv2](http://cfs.ncep.noaa.gov/): Operational global climate forecast model generated by NCEP/NCAR and distributed by NOAA.  Covers the time period from 3/2011 - Present. Sub-daily data.
-[GFS](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs): Operational global weather forecast  model generated by NCEP/NCAR and distributed by NOAA. Covers the time period from 3/2004 to Present. Sub-daily data.
-[JRA55](http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/gmd/jra/atlas/en/index.html): Global climate reanalysis generated by the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA). Covers the time period from 1958 to 2016. Sub-daily data.
